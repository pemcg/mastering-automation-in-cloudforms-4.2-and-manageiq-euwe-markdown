We saw in Part II how we can provision virtual machines from the WebUI.
This process involves entering values for the many provisioning dialog
options, such as our name and email address, and the desired
configuration of the virtual machine; the number of CPUs, amount of
memory, disk format, and vLAN for example. We also saw in Part III how
we can configure virtual machines using Ansible Tower from Automate.

CloudForms and ManageIQ also enable us to create service catalogs that
enable us to provision and configure virtual machines from a single
**Order** button (see [figure\_title](#p3i1)).

In Part IV weâ€™ll learn about creating and using services.
